Ensures that Helioviewer client uses version 2 of Helioviewer API exclusively.
The version 2 of the API made source id as a necessary parameter so we had to pass it
to the API. We have not changed the function definition but now we pass the source id
internally to the API. We have also added a new function that organizes the datasource
dictionary in a better way.
